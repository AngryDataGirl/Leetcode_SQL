```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE UnpivotProducts()
BEGIN

# 1. Break the problem into individual queries

# SELECT product_id, "LC_Store" AS store, LC_Store AS price
# FROM Products
# WHERE LC_Store IS NOT NULL

# 2. Combine queries dynamically
# 3. An individual query can be constructed if we know the store's name - replace LC_Store with the variable
# 4. We can get the store names (the column names) from the table's meta information - these are the COLUMN_NAMEs from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS; make sure to ignore the "product_id" column
# 5. The individual query can be combined using GROUP_CONCAT and " UNION " as a separator
# 6. Increase the max length allowed for GROUP_CONCAT

    SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 1000000;
    SET @case_stmt = NULL;

	SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(
            'SELECT product_id, "', COLUMN_NAME, '" AS store, ', COLUMN_NAME, ' AS price FROM Products WHERE ', COLUMN_NAME,' IS NOT NULL' SEPARATOR " UNION "
        )
    INTO @case_stmt
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME="Products" AND COLUMN_NAME != "product_id";

    SET @sql_query = @case_stmt;

    PREPARE final_sql_query FROM @sql_query;
    EXECUTE final_sql_query;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE final_sql_query;
