- count length
- replace character with '' then substract len from original len, this will give count of characters

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT tweet_id
FROM
(
    SELECT
    tweet_id,
    # tweet is invalid if longer than 140
    LENGTH(content) as len_tweet,
    # tweet is invalid if it has more than 3 mentions
    LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content,'@','')) as mentions,
    # tweet is invalid if it has more than 3 hashtags
    LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content,'#','')) as hashtags
FROM Tweets
) t
WHERE
    len_tweet > 140
    OR mentions > 3
    OR hashtags > 3
ORDER BY tweet_id ASC
```

or without the subquery

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT
tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE
# tweet is invalid if more than 140 characters
LENGTH(content) > 140
# tweet is invalid if it has more than 3 mentions
OR LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content,'@','')) > 3
# tweet is invalid if it has more than 3 hashtags
OR LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content,'#','')) > 3
ORDER BY tweet_id ASC
