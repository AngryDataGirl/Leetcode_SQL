# Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/

# Concepts
- filtering data with a WHERE clause 
- multiple conditions in WHERE clause

# Intuition
- the data is in a single table
- the filters are columns in the table 
- therefore, we can just specify the conditions in a WHERE clause

# Solution
```sql
select 
    product_id 
from 
    Products 
where 
    low_fats='Y' 
    and recyclable='Y';
```
