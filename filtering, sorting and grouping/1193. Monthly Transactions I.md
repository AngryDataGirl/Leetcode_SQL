```sql
SELECT  
    # creates the date in the month_approved format required for output
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') as month, 
    country,
    # total transactions count is simple, we just count the id
    COUNT(id) as trans_count,
    # this counts only those with state approved 
    COUNT(CASE 
            WHEN state = 'approved' THEN state 
            WHEN state = 'declined' THEN NULL
            END) AS approved_count,
    # total amount 
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    # sums the total amounts only if the state was "approved" 
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
# group by to appropriately group the aggregate calculations
GROUP BY 1, 2
