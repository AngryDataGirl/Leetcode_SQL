- weird casting , no specification in the question, for me it was just the report year that needed to be cast into the proper CHAR type

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH recursive cte1 AS 
(
    #anchor
    SELECT 2018 as report_year
    UNION ALL
    #recursive 
    SELECT report_year + 1
    FROM cte1
    #condition
    WHERE report_year < (SELECT max(year(period_end)) FROM Sales)

)
,
cte2 AS (
SELECT *, 
    CASE 
        #when period start and end is same as report year
        WHEN year(period_start) = report_year AND year(period_end) = report_year 
            THEN DATEDIFF(period_end, period_start) + 1
        #when period start as same as report year but period end is not
        WHEN year(period_start) = report_year AND year(period_end) <> report_year 
            THEN DATEDIFF(DATE(CONCAT(year(period_start),"-12-31")), period_start) + 1
        #when period start and period end both not same as year
        WHEN year(period_start) <> report_year AND year(period_end) <> report_year
            THEN DATEDIFF(
                DATE(CONCAT(report_year,"-12-31")),
                DATE(CONCAT(report_year,"-01-01"))
                    ) + 1
        #when period end is same as report year 
        WHEN year(period_start) <> report_year AND year(period_end) = report_year
            THEN DATEDIFF(period_end, DATE(CONCAT(report_year,"-01-01"))) + 1 
        ELSE DATEDIFF(period_end, period_start)
        END AS sale_days_in_year
FROM Sales s, cte1
WHERE report_year >= year(period_start) AND report_year <= year(period_end)
ORDER BY product_id
)

SELECT 
    c.product_id, 
    p.product_name, 
    CAST(c.report_year AS CHAR(4)) as report_year, 
    sale_days_in_year * average_daily_sales as total_amount
FROM cte2 c
LEFT JOIN Product p ON p.product_id = c.product_id 
ORDER BY c.product_id, c.report_Year
