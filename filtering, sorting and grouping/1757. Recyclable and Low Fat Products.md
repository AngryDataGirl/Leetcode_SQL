- filtering data with a WHERE clause 
- multiple conditions in WHERE clause
- the data is in a single table
- the filters are columns in the table 
- therefore, we can just specify the conditions in a WHERE clause

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id 
FROM 
    Products 
WHERE 
    low_fats='Y' 
    and recyclable='Y';
```
