https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-orders-and-customers-per-month/

```sql
select 
    distinct left(order_date, 7) as month, 
    count(distinct order_id) as order_count, 
    count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
from Orders
where invoice > '20'
group by month;
```

second solution, different syntax

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    COUNT(distinct order_id) as order_count, 
    COUNT(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
FROM Orders o 
WHERE invoice > 20
GROUP BY month
```
