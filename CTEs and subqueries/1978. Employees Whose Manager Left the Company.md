```sql
WITH manager_left AS 
(
SELECT DISTINCT 
    manager_id 
FROM 
    Employees 
WHERE 
    manager_id NOT IN (
            SELECT DISTINCT employee_id 
            FROM Employees
            )
),

emp_salary_30 AS
(
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id, 
    e1.name, 
    e1.manager_id, 
    e1.salary
FROM 
    Employees e1
WHERE 
    e1.salary < 30000)

SELECT 
    employee_id 
FROM 
    emp_salary_30
WHERE 
    manager_id IN (
            SELECT * 
            FROM manager_left)
ORDER BY employee_id
```
simpler and more performant 
```sql
SELECT employee_id 
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000
AND manager_id NOT IN (
    SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id
```
