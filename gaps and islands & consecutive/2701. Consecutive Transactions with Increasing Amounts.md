https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-transactions-with-increasing-amounts/

- the main trick with this problem is that there are two groups we need to keep track of 
- first, the consecutive date streaks per customer
    - the id / key is the transaction dates (since this is the contiguous set we are trying to find)
    - the values is the transaction date partitioned by the customer id 
- second, the date streaks where the amount was increasing 
- note that you have to turn the dates into integer values, else it will fail the last case with customer 29 
- note that you also have to use row_number(), dense rank will also fail a case 

```sql

    t.*,
    -- ranking of the dates - ranking of the dates by customer to create groups
