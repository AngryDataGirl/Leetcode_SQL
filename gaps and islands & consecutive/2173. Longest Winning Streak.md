- since we are trying to find the winning streaks
    - key : match day
    - values: match day where result = win

```sql
#add row number
WITH cte AS 
(
SELECT 
    player_id,
    match_day, 
    result, 
    row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) as rn
FROM Matches
)
#separate the wins records
,
cte2 AS 
(
SELECT 
    player_id,
    # this creates the group id 
    rn - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS group_id
FROM cte
WHERE result = 'Win'
)
#count the win streaks
,
win_streaks AS 
(
SELECT 
    player_id, 
    count(group_id) as win_streak
FROM cte2 
# WHERE player_id = 429        
GROUP BY player_id, group_id
)

SELECT DISTINCT 
    m.player_id, IFNULL(longest_streak,0) as longest_streak
FROM Matches m
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT player_id, 
        MAX(win_streak) as longest_streak
    FROM win_streaks
    GROUP BY player_id
) t 
ON t.player_id = m.player_id
```
