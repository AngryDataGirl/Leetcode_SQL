`There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.` Usually means you have to add DISTINCT in the queries. Additionally, the average was weird, since it said “do not care about action or remove dates” so if you added 0 for all action dates it would give wrong average, also need to make remove / total spam (not the reverse).

```sql
WITH spam AS
(
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id, post_id, action_date, action, extra
    FROM Actions
    WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam'
),
spam_removes AS 
(
SELECT DISTINCT action_date, IFNULL(s.post_id,NULL) as spam_id, IFNULL(r.post_id,NULL) as remove_id
FROM spam s 
LEFT JOIN Removals r ON r.post_id = s.post_id
),
percentages_table AS 
(
SELECT action_date, COUNT(remove_id) as trem, COUNT(spam_id) as tspam, COUNT(remove_id)/COUNT(spam_id)*100 as percentage
FROM spam_removes
GROUP BY action_date
)

SELECT ROUND(avg(percentage),2) as average_daily_percent
FROM percentages_table
```
