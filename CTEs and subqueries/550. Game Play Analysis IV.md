```sql
# get the first login and next_login date
WITH logins AS 
(
SELECT 
    dense_rank() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as rnk,
    lead(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as next_login,
    player_id, 
    device_id, 
    event_date, 
    games_played
FROM 
    Activity a
)

SELECT 
    # round the final fraction
    ROUND(
        (
        # count only of the next login is same as subsequent day
        COUNT(
            CASE WHEN rnk = 1 AND next_login = event_date + 1 
            THEN 1 ELSE NULL END
            ) 
        # divide by total unique players
        / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)),2) as fraction
FROM logins
```
alternate solution using CTEs to break out the calculations

```sql
WITH first_login AS 
(
    SELECT player_id, min(a.event_date)
    FROM Activity a
    GROUP BY a.player_id
),
day_after_login as 
(
    SELECT player_id, DATE(min(a.event_date)+1) as event_date
    FROM Activity a
    GROUP BY a.player_id
),
user_who_logged_in AS
(
SELECT a.player_id, a.event_date
FROM Activity a
JOIN day_after_login dl ON dl.player_id = a.player_id
    AND dl.event_date = a.event_date
GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT ui.player_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id),2) as fraction
FROM Activity a, user_who_logged_in ui
```
