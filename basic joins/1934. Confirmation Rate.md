```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH tr AS 
(
SELECT *, count(action) as total_requests
FROM Confirmations
GROUP BY user_id
)
,
cr AS 
(
SELECT *, count(action) as confirmed_requests
FROM Confirmations
WHERE action = 'confirmed' 
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT 
    s.user_id, 
    ROUND(IFNULL(IFNULL(cr.confirmed_requests,0)/IFNULL(tr.total_requests,0),0),2) as confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN tr ON tr.user_id = s.user_id
LEFT JOIN cr ON cr.user_id = s.user_id
```

alternative solution using a CASE WHEN / COUNT statement as opposed to separate CTEs
```sql
WITH totals AS 
(
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN action = "confirmed" then 1 ELSE NULL END) as total_confirms,
    COUNT(action) as total_requested
FROM Confirmations
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT 
    s.user_id,
    IFNULL(ROUND(t.total_confirms/t.total_requested, 2),0) as confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN totals t
    ON s.user_id = t.user_id
```
