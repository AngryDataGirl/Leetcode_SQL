# the join will create the final table where we can subtract one column from the other
SELECT 
    s.machine_id, 
# need to find average and round to 3 decimal places
    ROUND(AVG(e.end_timestamp - s.start_timestamp),3) as processing_time

JOIN end e
# ensure the join is correct as the machine and process both have ids
    ON e.machine_id = s.machine_id
    AND e.process_id = s.process_id
# we group by machine id, since the proceses should be avged
GROUP BY s.machine_id
