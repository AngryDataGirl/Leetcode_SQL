### 579
Find Cumulative Salary of an Employee
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-cumulative-salary-of-an-employee/

- So, I initially failed case 7 due to an incorrect partition (the lag was missing a PARTITION BY and instead I put the ORDER BY id, month) 
- Without parititioning it by id, the lagged variable will take the previous id / month even if it's a different person
- ie, with id 3 and month 1 , the lag actually grabbed the later rows of id 2  

```sql
# recursive to generate the missing months (1 through 12 whether or not the employee worked) 
WITH RECURSIVE sal_months AS 
(
    SELECT 
        id, 
        1 as month    
    FROM Employee 

    UNION

    SELECT 
        id,
        month + 1
    FROM sal_months
    WHERE month < 12
)
,
decompressed AS 
(
# join the months into the recursive query so we can get 0 for the months not currently in the table 
SELECT sm.id, sm.month, IFNULL(e.salary,0) as salary
FROM sal_months sm
LEFT JOIN Employee e 
    ON e.id = sm.id
    AND e.month = sm.month
ORDER BY id, month
)
,
LAGGED as 
(
# create the lagged variables, lagging 1 month and lagging 2 month
SELECT 
    id, month, salary,
    IFNULL(LAG(salary, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY month),0) as lag1_salary,
    ifnull(LAG(salary, 2) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY month),0) as lag2_salary
FROM decompressed 
)
,
filter AS (
# create another row number to remove the max / most recent date 
    SELECT
        row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY month DESC) as rn, 
        id, 
        month, 
        salary
    FROM Employee 
)

SELECT
