```sql
SELECT 
distinct l1.num as "ConsecutiveNums"

FROM
Logs l1, 
Logs l2,
logs l3

WHERE
l1.id = l2.id-1
and 
l2.id = l3.id-1
and 
(l1.num = l2.num) and (l2.num = l3.num)

ORDER BY

l1.Id, l2.Id, l3.Id
```
- alternate solution using window functions LAG and LEAD
- personally I find this more readable

```sql
WITH lagged AS (

SELECT 
lag(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) as last_num,
num, 
lead(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) as next_num
FROM Logs

)

SELECT DISTINCT num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM lagged
WHERE last_num = num AND next_num = num
```
