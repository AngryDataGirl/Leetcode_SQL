```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH combined AS
(
SELECT 
    c.trans_id as id,
    t.country as country, 
    'chargeback' as state, 
    t.amount as amount, 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date,'%Y-%m') as month 
FROM Chargebacks c
JOIN Transactions t ON c.trans_id = t.id
UNION
SELECT 
    t1.id, 
    t1.country, 
    t1.state, 
    t1.amount, 
    DATE_FORMAT(t1.trans_date,'%Y-%m') as month 
FROM Transactions t1
)
,
total as (
SELECT 
    month, 
    country, 
    SUM(IF(state = 'approved',1,0)) as approved_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as approved_amount,
    SUM(IF(state = 'chargeback',1,0)) as chargeback_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'chargeback' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as chargeback_amount
FROM combined
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT *
FROM total
WHERE (approved_count != 0 
OR approved_amount != 0 
OR chargeback_count != 0 
OR chargeback_amount != 0)
```

or second solution

```sql
select left(trans_date,7) as month, country,  
sum(case when state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 end) as approved_count,
sum(case when state = 'approved' then amount else 0 end) as approved_amount,
sum(case when state = 'chargeback' then 1 else 0 end) as chargeback_count,
sum(case when state = 'chargeback' then amount else 0 end) as chargeback_amount
from 
    (select trans_id as id, country, 'chargeback' as state, amount, Chargebacks.trans_date  as trans_date 
    from Chargebacks 
    join Transactions on Transactions.id = Chargebacks.trans_id
    union
    select id, country, state, amount, trans_date 
    from Transactions) as tmp1
group by month,country
having (approved_count+approved_amount+chargeback_count+chargeback_amount) > 0;
```
