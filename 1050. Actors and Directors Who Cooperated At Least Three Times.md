# Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/actors-and-directors-who-cooperated-at-least-three-times/

# Intuition
- the table is already shaped in a way where we can aggregate the actor/director pair
- the question is simply looking for a group by / having count 
- you could use a WHERE clause, but you would have to perform the aggregation and count in a subquery / CTE 

# Solution using HAVING
```sql
SELECT 
  a1.actor_id, 
  a1.director_id
FROM 
  ActorDirector a1
GROUP BY 
  a1.actor_id, 
  a1.director_id
HAVING 
  COUNT(timestamp) >= 3
```

# Solution using WHERE
```sql

SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM
(
SELECT 
  actor_id, 
  director_id, 
  count(timestamp) as total_collab
FROM 
  ActorDirector
GROUP BY 
  actor_id, 
  director_id
) t
WHERE 
  total_collab >= 3
```
