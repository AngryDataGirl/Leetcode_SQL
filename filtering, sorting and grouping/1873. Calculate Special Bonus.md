https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/

```sql
SELECT employee_id, if((employee_id % 2 <> 0)
                       and name not like 'M%',
                       salary,
                       0) as bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id

-- Method 1. Using CASE Expression https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp
SELECT employee_id, 
CASE WHEN employee_id % 2 = 1 and name not like 'M%' 
THEN salary 
ELSE 0 
END AS bonus 
FROM Employees 
ORDER BY employee_id;

-- Method 2. Using IF Function https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_if.asp
SELECT employee_id, IF(employee_id % 2 = 1 and name not like 'M%', salary, 0) AS bonus 
FROM Employees 
ORDER BY employee_id;

-- Difference: The IF statement is useful if you're trying to evaluate something to a TRUE/FALSE condition. The CASE statement is used when you have multiple possible conditions.

-- Method 3. Without CASE and IF.
SELECT employee_id, salary * (employee_id % 2) * (name not like 'M%') as bonus 
FROM Employees 
ORDER BY employee_id;
-- The above one is simple, as the value of boolean is between 1, 0 so simply when the condition is not met the bonus become 0 else salary.
